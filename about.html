	Formed on July 2016, for {ada} was created by four female coders.
	As the technology industry has continued to expand, many studies have shown that the percentage of girls interested or pursuing STEM has been very small compared to that of boys.
	This is because of what each gender is exposed to, girls are encouraged to pursue more “feminine” careers such as dancers or writers, while boys typically are encouraged to be scientists or athletes.
	What girls are not told is that many times STEM is incorporated into a wide variety of fields, from art to film.
	Due to this lack of STEM exposure to young girls, our group is creating a community powered website that brings awareness to all things tech related.
	We hope to provide encouragement to young girls to pursue STEM fields by providing role models and a place where girls can encourage each other and help each other find success in their respective fields.
